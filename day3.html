  Dosa Recipes- An indispensable South Indian classic, dosa is ubiquitous in India. Just a bite of those thin, wafer-like crepes loaded with flavouful masalas transports you to heaven. Did you know that the 'dosa' is listed on the World's 50 most Delicious Foods? It also comes under the list of top ten Tasty Foods of the world and we are not complaining. And once you will try one of these creative and delicious dosa recipes, you'll vouch for the rankings as well.
